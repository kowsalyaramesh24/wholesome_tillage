						<h3>About Beetroot</h3>
                                                <p>The beetroot is the taproot portion of a beet plant, usually known in Canada and the USA as beets while the vegetable is referred to as beetroot in British English, and also known as the table beet, garden beet, red beet, dinner beet or golden beet. It is one of several cultivated varieties of Beta vulgaris grown for their edible taproots and leaves (called beet greens); they have been classified as B. vulgaris subsp. vulgaris 'Conditiva' Group.</br>Besides being used as a food, beets have uses as a food colouring and as a medicinal plant. Many beet products are made from other Beta vulgaris varieties, particularly sugar beet.</p>

                                                <h3>Pre-Plant</h3><p>Before planting horticultural crops in an organic system it is important to minimize potential weed pressure. Mechanically this can be achieved with shallow cultivations to stimulate weed seed germination. The soil should be worked lightly to stimulate germination and then worked again one to two weeks later to kill the emerged weeds.  This procedure can be done more than once depending on the weed pressure of specific fields.</br>Pre-plant tillage can be completed with harrows, roto-tillers or cultivators.  Whichever implement is used it is important that the final pass leave a firm, level seedbed.</p>
                                                <h3>Crop rotation</h3>
                                                <p>A one in four crop rotation is the minimum required for red beets to prevent disease and pest build-up.  For organic production, one year in six years is preferable. It is important to take into account the other family members in the rotation such as Swiss chard and spinach to reduce a build up of crop specific pests and disease.  In a rotation with Brassicas or spinach, the beet cyst nematode may become a problem.  Wireworm may be a concern if planting into old pasture or hay fields. Good rotational crops for beets include potatoes, grain, onions and legumes</p>
                                                <h3>Fertility</h3>
                                                <p>All fertilizer applications should be based on a comprehensive soil sample.  Beets need a total nutrient requirement per hectare of 250 kg of Nitrogen, 50 kg of Phosphorus, 270 kg of Potassium, and 4.5 kg of Boron. Manganese may also need to be added depending on soil samples.  Calcium and Magnesium may be supplied through dolmitic or calcitic limestone. Use lime to maintain a pH of 6.5 to 6.8 in all parts of the field.</p>                                                                                              
                                                <h3>Varieties</h3>
                                                 <p>Three varieties were planted: Red Cloud, Red Ace and Moneta.  These varieties were chosen to produce the greatest sugar content and quality.  Most beet seed are multi-germinating which means that each seed can produce more than one beet.  Multi-germinating seed can result in uneven stands and sizing in the crop.  For this reason a mono-germinating variety (Moneta) was also planted to evaluate whether there was any improvement in size and yield.</p>

                                                 <h3>Planting</h3>
                                                 <img src="{% static 'images/37.jpg' %}" align="right" width="500" height="200">
                                                 <p>Red beets can be seeded whenever the soil has warmed up in the spring. Ideally soil temperature should be around 150C. On Prince Edward Island planting can be done from late May until the first week of July. Later planting will not produce the size profile required to meet processing requirements. Earlier planting will generate higher yields and an earlier harvest.  An early harvest should mean a cleaner product going into storage.</p>
                                                 <h3>Weed Control</h3>
                                                 <p>Weed control during the first 4-6 weeks of growth is very important. Beyond that the beets should be able to compete with weeds without significant reduction in yield.  High weed pressure will reduce marketable yield and may also create problems during harvest and subsequent storage. Once the red beets have established a good canopy of leaves they are more competitive against weeds.  Prior to reaching canopy cover, the beets provide little competition for weeds.</p>
                                                 <h3>Diseases</h3>
                                                 <p>Leaf Spot (Cercospora beticola Sacc.) causes one of the most widespread, destructive and economically significant beet diseases in the world. Cercospora leaf spot fungus feeds on the beet’s sap.  Early infection before the beets begins to bulk will have the greatest effect on yield and quality. An infection occurring later in the season will usually only effect sugar levels and juice purity but not yield.  Less than 30 spots per leaf will not appreciably reduce yield or quality.</br>Under the correct environmental conditions the spots grow rapidly and become brownish and bright purple in colour.  As the spots increase in number, the leaves turn yellow then brown and eventually die.  The cause of leaf spot is free moisture on the leaves from relative humidity above 90%, day time temperatures between 250C- 350C and night temperature above 150C. These conditions allow moisture to stay on the leaves for a prolonged period of time.</br>Control in organic production is very limited.  A  4-5 year rotation is recommended. If possible remove infected leaves at harvest.  Good weed control and increased spacing between plants will increase air flow and reduce standing water on plants during times of high humidity.<img src="{% static 'images/38.jpg' %}" align="right" width="500" height="500"></br>Rhizoctonia is a soil born fungus disease in red beets.  Rhizoctonia can result in 30-60% yield loss and even the loss of an entire field.  Often times, Rhizoctonia is responsible for damage to seedlings as they germinate. Once infected, the plants become vulnerable to other diseases such as damping off.</br>The best way to manage this disease is to plant red beets under ideal conditions, with temperatures around 150C and sufficient moisture in the soil.It is also very important not to plant too deep, less than 1.5 cm.</br><img src="{% static 'images/39.jpg' %}" align="center" width="500" height="500"></p>

                                                 <h3>Harvest</h3>
                                                 <p>Harvest generally starts in September and depending on the area to harvest can last into October.  Red beets can tolerate a light night frost. The harvest date also depends on the required size profile of the beets.</br>Red beets can be harvested with standard potato harvesting equipment or with a specialized carrot harvester. A carrot harvester is preferred for fresh market beets (beet sold with top). For processing beets, a potato harvester is recommended as it has a higher volume capacity. Beets can be harvested in one pass or windrowed first. This depends on the equipment available.</br>It is important during harvest that beets are as clean as possible leaving the field. Excess soil and weed or leaf material in the beets can result in significant loss in storage.  The soil or leaf material restricts airflow through the pile causing the pile to heat.
