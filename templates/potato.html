						<h3>About Potato</h3>
                                                <p>Potato is one of the major food crops of Nepal. The average productivity of potato tuber in Nepal is 13.13 metric ton/hectors in 2071/72 B.S. (Agriculture diary, 2073 B.S.), which is far behind from the productivity of other developed countries. For increasing the productivity, the quality seed tuber production and improved cultivation technique is the main factor. Quality seed tuber means the tuber free from seed borne diseases. Generally, suitable area for the production of high quality seed tuber in Nepal is high hill region i.e. 2000 meter above from mean sea level (MoAD, Nepal).</br>The seed borne diseases spread quickly, and cannot be controlled using chemicals as well. Use of healthy and disease free seed tuber following crop rotation with proper field inspection can help to minimize the seed borne disease. Hence, this manual tries to provide some idea for the production of quality seed tuber via improved techniques and cooperative</p>

                                                <h3>Suitable environment for potato seed tuber production:</h3><p>Area with cool weather during cultivation period and altitude over 2000 meter is better for the seed tuber production in Nepal because of disease and pest attack is less in that area. In the mid hill areas, the seed tubers should be planted a little earlier to end of the frost </p>
                                                <h3>Selection of plot</h3>
                                                <p>The site for producing seed potato should be in sunny area with fertile soil.</br>The spacing distance between the plots of potato seed tuber farming and other solanum crop farming should be of minimum 30 meters.</br>We should select the plot where the aphid and other insect cannot easily come out from other solanum field for controlling disease</p>

                                                <h3>Preparation of field:</h3>
                                                <h3>Field sanitation before plantation</h3>
                                                <p>In case residues of earlier crops remain in the field, the larva of the pest and disease of the previous crops stay alive in soil, and attack the new crops as well. Therefore, field should be cleaned after harvesting of any crop. </p>                                                                                              
                                                <h3>First plowing</h3><img src="{% static 'images/42.jpg' %}" align="right" width="700" height="500"></p>
                                                 <p>1-2 month before planting, during Dec-Jan first plowing should be done.</br>Plowing should be done after applying the well fermented FYM (50-60 Doko/ Ropani) as organic fertilizer on the field.</br>Plough the field two times, which will make the soil loose and make easy for aeration and root growth. In the first time, it should be 5-8 cm deep plowing, and second time 10-15 cm deep plowing.</p>
                                                 <h3>Second plowing</h3>
                                                 <p>During second plowing time, dig the field manually by spade about 8-10 cm. making the line.</br>Then apply 2.8 kg Urea, 1.4 kg DAP and1.4 kg Potash for a Ropani in lines, and mixed well with soil and made ridge.</br>The ridge should be 25-30 cm. in height and 30-35 cm. in width in each row.</p>
                                                 <h3>Planting:</h3>
                                                 <h3>Planting density</h3>
                                                 <p>Planting density varies with planting distance. The planting space varied 22-26cm from tuber to tuber and 70-84 cm from line to line depending upon variety.</p>
                                                 <h3>Planting method</h3><img src="{% static 'images/43.jpg' %}" align="center" width="700" height="500"></p>
                                                 <p>Potato seeds tuber should be planted 7-8 cm deep.</br>The ridge should be 25-30 cm. in height and 30-35 cm. in width in each row.</p>
  						 <h3>Irrigation</h3>
                                                 <p>Potatoes should be irrigated time to time in case field becomes very dry and there is irrigation facility. But, there should not be irrigation more than necessary.</br>While irrigation in potato, the ridge should be wet, but it should not dipped fully, and irrigation should be done in the middle of two ridges.
                                                 <h3>General description on pest and disease</h3><img src="{% static 'images/44.jpg' %}" align="right" width="700" height="500"></p>
                                                 <p>Generally, the virus infected potatoes cannot be identified just by visually.</br>The symptoms such as mosaic leaves, folded leaves, wrinkled and yellowish leaves are caused by the virus infection, which can be observed on the plants in the field.</br>If the infected virus potatoes are mixed with the non-infected seed potato, the virus spreads to others easily. </p>
                                                 <h3>Pests</h3>
                                                 <p>Among the pests of the potato tuber, moth is the most destructive. This moth can cause considerable damage in the field or store within a few days.</p> 
                                                 <h3>Harvest</h3>
                                                 <h3>Harvesting Time</h3>
                                                 <p>After haulm cutting, the harvesting of tubers should be finished within 10-15 days. After than 15 days, there will be increased the chance of disease infection and tuber goes rotten.</br>In case of Potato tuber harvesting in rainy days, tuber can be rotten easily. Therefore, a sunny day should be selected for harvesting.<img src="{% static 'images/45.jpg' %}" align="center" width="700" height="500">

                                                 <p>Dig up the potatoes around the each remaining cut stem on the field. In case of damaged seed tuber potato while harvesting, those tubers should be used for food.</br>After harvesting, the damaged, diseased, green skinned and small potato tuber as well as plant residues should not be remained in the field for sanitation of field.</p>
