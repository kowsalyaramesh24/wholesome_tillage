						<h3>About Carrot</h3>
                                                <p>Carrots (Daucus carota L. ssp. sativus) belong to the Apiaceae family and is a hardy, cool-season biennial that is grown for the thickened root it produces in its first growing season.</br>Although carrots can endure summer heat in many areas, they grow best when planted in the cool season. Carrots are eaten both raw and cooked and they can be stored for winter use. They are rich in carotene (the source of vitamin A) and high in fiber and sugar content.

                                                <h3>Ecological Requirements</h3><p>The carrot is a plant that grows in mediterranian climates. Maximum growth is reached at a medium temperature of 18° C and a well balanced water supply. It withstands low temperatures, even light freeze, but suffers under heat and drought. However, adapted varieties make growing of carrots at temperatures around 25° C possible.</br>A soil temperature in the range of 15 to 20° C produces the sweetest, most tender and brightly colored roots. Higher soil temperatures lead to stubbier roots with a woody texture and strong flavor. While the total percentage of sugar in a carrot root does not increase with age, there is a shift from glucose (simple sugar) to sucrose (table sugar).</p>
                                                <h3>Suitable Varieties</h3>
                                                <p>It is important that season specific varieties for summer or winter are used.</p>
                                                <h3>Propagation</h3>
                                                <p>Carrots are sown directly on the field. In order to archive a high percentage of germinating seeds, the soil structure should be well prepared (without excessive tillage). Seeds need to be planted near to the surface and to be covered lightly with 0.3-0.6 cm of soil. Germination is slow and irregular.</br>Carrot cultivation for seed production of different varieties must be widely separated for purity reasons. This includes wild carrots from adjacnet areas, as they are able to cross with cultivars.</p>
                                                                                              
                                                <h3>Design of the Rotation</h3>
                                                 <p>Carrots may be rotated with alfalfa or other leguminous cover crops, small grains, onions, spinach. In order to reduce soil borne disease problems rotation with crops like celery, parsley, beets and sesbania shall be avoided.</p>

                                                 <h3>Fertilization</h3>
                                                 <p>Levels of phosphorus and potassium should be higher if compared to other crops. Also, boron deficiency can lead to carrot cracking.</p>
                                                 <h3>Irrigation</h3>
                                                 <p>Moisture management in carrots is especially important during stand establishment and during root expansion. Since small carrot seeds are unable to emerge when surface crusting occurs and can be burnt off if surface temperatures are too high, irrigation during the pre-emergence period revolves around maintaining a moist, cool, loose soil surface. This often requires frequent, light irrigation.</br>During the last half of the growing period, irrigate only early in the day to allow for rapid canopy drying whenever possible. Soils should also be allowed to dry to 50 percent of available soil moisture during harvest to prevent excessive cracking and damage to roots during harvest.</br>On most soils, weekly irrigation during the peak is adequate, however with sandy and sandy loam soils, irrigation may be required as frequently as every three to four days.</p>

                                                <h3>Weed Management</h3>
 						<p>Weed management is important mostly during the first stages, when the carrot plants are still very small and weak. Soil should be covered with dry matter of any kind.</p>
                                                <h3>Harvesting and Post Harvest Handling</h3>
 						<p>Mature carrots are well adapted for storage and are stored in large quantities during the fall and winter for both the fresh market and processing. Careful handling during and after harvest to avoid bruising, cutting and breakage will help ensure successful storage.</br>Mature topped carrots can be stored 7 to 9 months at 0° to 1°C with a very high relative humidity, 98 to 100 %.</br>However, even under these optimum conditions 10 to 20 % of the carrots may show some decay after 7 months. Under commonly found commercial conditions (0° to 4°C) with 90  to 95 % relative humidity, 5 to 6 months storage is a more realistic expectation. Prompt cooling to 4°C or below after harvest is essential for extended storage. Poorly pre-cooled roots decay more rapidly.</br>Carrots lose moisture readily and wilting results. Humidity should be kept high. Carrots stored at 98 to 100% relative humidity develop less decay, lose less moisture, and remain crisper than those stored at 90 to 95 % relative humidity. A temperature of –1°C to 1°C is essential if decay and sprouting are to be minimized.
