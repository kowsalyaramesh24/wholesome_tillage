						<h3>About Tomato</h3>
                                                The tomato is one of the most popular vegetables in conventional and in organic agriculture. It is important for the fresh market and for processing, and is produced all over the world. Efficient harvesting, handling, and marketing techniques are especially important in the production of organic tomato, as it is a highly perishable crop.</br>Tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) belong to the Solanaceae family and are related to egg plants, paprika, and potatoes. There are different forms and colors of tomatoes: small, medium size and long. The colors vary from red to yellow and orange to green.</p>

                                                <h3>Ecological Requirements</h3>
                                                <p>Tomatoes are found in wild form in the tropical Andes. All similar climates and soil conditions are favorable to tomatoes. However, tomato grows on a wide range of climates and soil.</p>

                                                <h3>Soil</h3>
                                                <p>Tomatoes do not have high requirements regarding the soil type where they will be grown. However, heavy soils and high clay soils can favor the development of diseases. Loamy sandy soils with a good depth of drainage and a high content of nutrients are ideal for tomato production. Tomatoes grow well in alkaline soils, but the tomatoes prefer neutral to light acid soils (pH 5.5 to 7). Tomatoes build an extensive root system that can reach very deep zones in the soil. Tomatoes are adventitious and propagate in large quantities; the rooting of the soil on the first top layers is strong, therefore care should be taken in weeding with a hoe.</p>

                                                <h3>Temperature</h3>
                                                 <p>Tomatoes like warm temperatures and plenty of sunlight. They are sensitive to low temperatures and highly sensitive to frost. Therefore, production areas and types of green houses have to be selected carefully.</br>By temperatures over 32°C and under 15°C the tomatofruits do not grow uniformly. Tomatoes are self-pollinizers. For good fecundation, tomatoes require a relative humidity levelof 60 to 80%, and a temperature around 23°C. At temperature less than 13°C or more than 27°C, fecundation is poor.</p>
                                                <h3>Suitable varieties</h3>
                                                <p>Most traders, retailers and supermarkets actually prefer specially firm durable varieties in order to minimize losses due to all the handling along the logistic chain from the field to the shop. Traditional types of tomatoes have a durability of approximately of one week; there are new varieties for which traditional breeding (semi-longlife or longlife) and genetic engineering (“flavor savor”) have increased durability be four weeks. In organic agriculture, genetically manipulated tomatoes are not allowed. For organic growers, disease-resistance or tolerance is in many cases more important than other factors, such as durability.</br>flowering rotten than round tomatoes. Furthermore, local markets decide which varieties are in demand. Market demands, disease resistance, suitability to cropping systems and life storage period are factors that influence the selection of varieties in organic tomato production. . After transplanting, the mixture can contain up to 50% peat, 30 % high quality compost and 20% light soil. The use of 20-50% coir is also possible, but the salt content has to be low (coconuts not “stored” in the sea).</br></p>

                                                 <h3>Fertilization</h3>
                                                 <p> Organic fertilization decisions are influenced by different factors, such as soil and climate, crop rotation, manure sources, availability of compost turners, manure spreaders, fertilizer drills and availability of commercial organic fertilizer. Beans need the following nutrients per ha and year with a yield of 10-12 kg per m2:  170 kg nitrogen,  80 kg of phosphorous, 340 kg of potassium and 60 kg of magnesium. Enough phosphorus and potassium are available for tomatoes in most soils. Soils managed organically for several years may allow acceptable tomato-yields based on green manure with legumes and compost applications. However, in most cases, organic growers also apply nitrogen to the soil in the form of compost, manure and other organic nitrogen sources.</p>
                                                 <h3>Conditions for the Nutrient Availability</h3>
                                                 <p>Organic tomato production is based mainly on compost applications. Nitrogen in compost is organically fixed and has to be transformed in a soluble form (mineralized) by microorganisms. Soil-temperatures of 12-14°C, a good aereation and enough soil-moisture support mineralization. Phosphorous is not available for the tomatoes subjected to temperatures under 14°C. A phosphorous-deficiency in tomatoes is shown by a purple color on the under side of the leaves.</p>
                                                 <h3>Irrigation</h3><img src="{% static 'images/25.jpg' %}" align="right" width="500" height="500">
                                                 <p>Tomatoes in full productions evaporate about 4-6 l of water per m2 day. At the beginning and the end of the crop, 2 l per m2 day is more than enough. To improve root development, it is recommendable to limit irrigation for some weeks after planting. Regular irrigation is very important for the nutrient supply, plant health and fruit quality. Irrigation can be done by drop irrigation (most commonly used) and flood irrigation. Advantages and disadvantages of the different irrigation systems have to be evaluated carefully before investing in  organic tomato production; for example: flood irrigation may increase soil borne diseases; drip irrigation may increase salt concentrations in the top soil. </p>

                                                <p>Tomatoes are susceptible to physiological disturbances, diseases and pests. Priorities in organic tomato production have all the management methods to prevent such pests and diseases: 
Optimal site selection</br>Selection of pest and disease resistant varieties</br>Wide rotation (in case of soil borne diseases at least four years should be free of tomato-production)</br>Creation of semi-natural habitats and ecological compensation areas</p>                            
                                                <h3>Pests:</h3>
                                                <p>The worst pests for mangoes are cotton scales, mealy bugs, cicadas and black flies (create honey dew). These are all sucking insects that live on the leaves, young buds and shoots. They can cause a lot of damage. Yet they all have natural enemies, such as e.g. ladybird larvae, wasps, spiders and other types, such as parasitic fungi e.g. with cicadas and black flies.</br>An ecological plantation with a variety of crops, enough plots under different crops e.g. forest and a sufficient amount of vegetation to cover the soil and enrich the variety of species (e.g. mulching only right after the plants have flowered) will provide enough enemies to combat the pests so that measures against them are usually unnecessary. Cicadas are averse to open, well ventilated soil; also, the soil must be drained well to avoid wet patches.</br>In emergencies, the following methods should help:
 Scale insects can be regulated with a “winter-spraying”</br>i.e. with paraffin oil (white oil) shortly before the larvae hatch from their eggs. The paraffin oil is sprayed on as a 3 % water emulsion.Should they infest the tree, a solution of 1% soft soap</p><img src="{% static 'images/26.jpg' %}" align="center" width="500" height="300">
                                                
 
 <h3>Weed Management</h3><img src="{% static 'images/27.jpg' %}" align="right" width="500" height="500">
                                                <p>Successful weed regulation in organic tomato production is based on a combination of different strategies. The planning of a diverse crop rotation – especially those including cover crops that compete with weeds – is the first and most important step in organic tomato production. Organic growers also pay a great deal of attention to sanitation measures that avoid the introduction of weeds (seeds and propagules). Tomatoes have a critical period of about 4-5 weeks after transplanting where they need weed-free conditions.</p>

                                               <p>Harvesting tomatoes is labor intensive. For storage and shipping, the tomatoes can be picked at the initial stage of maturity- when the blossom end turns pink. Tomatoes can be harvested 2-3 times per week, preferably in the morning. Temperature-management is critical to maintain quality. The tomatoes should be stored at 10-13°C. The flavor will be reduced if tomatoes are stored at low temperatures; high temperatures accelerate fruit ripening.</p>
